1) Look at "interval" function and understand how it works.
2) perform a call to it, passing the appropriate parameters(config, function to execute and final callback).The function to execute needs to print "iteration number ${number}".  the final callback should print "done".
3)create a promise-based version of the function.
4)Use then(), in the same manner you have used the callback-based function.
5) Use async await the same way.
